Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome! You are encouraged to submit PRs, bug
reports, feature requests or add to the Wiki with examples and
tutorials. It would be fun to hear about unique and clever applications
you develop. Please see this
`README <https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/tree/master/tests>`__
for setting up a development environment and running tests.

Even if you aren't a developer, please participate in our
`discussions community <https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/discussions>`__.
Helping other users is another great way to contribute to pyscript!
