Releases and New Features
=========================

The releases and release notes are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript/releases>`__.
Use HACS to install different versions of pyscript.

You can also install the master (head of tree) version from GitHub, either using HACS or manually.
Because pyscript has quite a few unit tests, generally the master version should work ok. But it's not
guaranteed to work at any random time, and newly-added features might change.

    This release is 1.3.1, released on March 4, 2021.  Here is the `documentation
    <https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/1.3.1>`__ for this release.

The latest release is 1.3.1, released on March 4, 2021.  Here is the `documentation
<https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/1.3.1>`__ for that release.

Over time, the master (head of tree) version in GitHub will include new features and bug fixes.
Here is the `latest documentation <https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`__ if you want
to see the development version of the documentation.

If you want to see development progress since 1.3.1, see
`new features <https://hacs-pyscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/new_features.html>`__ in the latest
documentation, or look at the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript>`__.

Planned new features post 1.3.1 include:

- Services defined in pyscript should support entity methods if they include an ``entity_id`` keyword argument.
- Consider supporting the built-in functions that do I/O, such as ``open``, ``read`` and ``write``, which
  are not currently supported to avoid I/O in the main event loop, and also to avoid security issues if people
  share pyscripts. The ``print`` function only logs a message, rather than implements the real ``print`` features,
  such as specifying an output file handle. Support might be added in the future using an executor job, perhaps
  enabled when ``allow_all_imports`` is set.
